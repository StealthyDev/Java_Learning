Project to learn java.

03/22
Created package com.prashanth.learning.s5.Interface
Tried implementing Interface. Also implemented below:
1) Method Overloading - Process of calling the same method with different parameters.
2) Method Overriding - Process of calling the same method with different functionality in child class.
3) Encapsulation - Hiding the methods and variable within a class.

Need Clarifiaction:
1) Confused slightly on Method Overloading. When it will be useful? Anyway we have to create n times the same method by passing different parameters.
2) Not sure how to use the toString method.
